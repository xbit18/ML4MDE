# Machine Learning For Model Driven Engineering: Toxic Comment Classification

Social media users often encounter abuse, harassment, and insults from other users on most online communication platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc., due to which many users stop expressing their ideas and opinions.

The solution to this problem is to create an effective model that can identify the level of toxicity of comments, such as threats, obscenities, insults, racism, etc., thus promoting a peaceful environment for online dialogue.

We will better understand the multi-label classification of toxic comments and create a model to classify comments into different toxicity labels.
The multi-label classification is a supervised machine learning approach where a single instance can be associated with multiple labels simultaneously. 

It allows the model to assign zero, one, or more labels to each data sample based on its characteristics.

In the context of toxic comment classification, a comment or text can be labeled with multiple toxicity categories if it contains various forms of harmful language.
